### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is a project/bio page for Joel Mcanulty/Phantom Farmer. 
There are links to 4 projects and a link to a screenshot of code for each one, as well as a brief description of what I was learning for that particular code block.

In this code I was learning to render cards to the DOM that represented cards by different houses the students were assigned to. This was before we were using API's or even modularizing our code, so this code is located in a "main.js" file with a slew of other code blocks.

In this code I was learning API calls to pull data from Firebase to be passed into the vacabulary cards I would be rendering. THe API calls allow me to do CRUD on my project. I can create new cards, read existing ones, edit them, and delate them.
