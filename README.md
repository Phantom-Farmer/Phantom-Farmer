### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is a project/bio page for Joel Mcanulty/Phantom Farmer. 
There are links to 4 projects and a link to a screenshot of code for each one, as well as a brief description of what I was learning for that particular code block.

[link to my Sorting Hat project](https://github.com/Phantom-Farmer/INDIVIDUAL-PROJECT-sorting-hat)

In this code I was learning to render cards to the DOM that represented cards by different houses the students were assigned to. This was before we were using API's or even modularizing our code, so this code is located in a "main.js" file with a slew of other code blocks.

In this code I was learning API calls to pull data from Firebase to be passed into the vacabulary cards I would be rendering. THe API calls allow me to do CRUD on my project. I can create new cards, read existing ones, edit them, and delate them.

[link to my Joke Generator project](https://github.com/Phantom-Farmer/LAB-joke-generator-react)

Reference-code:

In this code I was learning how to use the useState hook in React to create a dynamic single page app that can use the else/if conditional to decide what data to retrieve from an API for the user to experience a joke set up, a punchline, and then the option to get another joke and continue their humorous experience.

[link to my Team Roster project](https://github.com/Phantom-Farmer/team-roster)

Reference-code: 
![alt text][team]

In this code I was learning to use both useState and useEffect hooks in React in order to do special routing for editing a player. I had to create a new folder of player functions and have a folder for editing specifically because we can not have multiple files with the same name in the same folder, so in order to edit my player, since I already had a routing file for firebaseKey to delete my player, I had to put the firebase file for editing in its own folder.
